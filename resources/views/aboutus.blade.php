                    <h2 class="text-left">committed to our core values</h2>
					<br/>
					
                    <p><i><strong>A firm without core values is more likely to fall apart.</strong></i></p>
                  
				<p>Noori Travels traces its origins to the century old flagship company M.A.M. Fida Ali & Sons. The flagship company started its 
				operations in Petroleum products, which grew into trading in allied products of the automobile industry viz. tyres, batteries 
				and spare parts. It also dealt with development of real estate properties.</p>
				
				<br/>
				
				<p>Self-expression, open communication, personal recognition and performance-based rewards are the values that serve as the 
				foundation for Noori’s success. By empowering employees as individuals and entrepreneurs, we uphold the principles that 
				Iftekhar Husain Fida Ali set forth back in 1974 when he founded Noori. With literally no predecessors to follow, he and his 
				small team of employees did not talk about core values; they simply lived them.</p>
				
				<br/>
				
				<p>As the reins of leadership have passed to the progeny, Noori Travels has maintained its founding philosophy and core values 
				and the result is a list of prestigious and satisfied clients all over the twin cities. These clients vouch for the service that has 
				been and being offered by Noori Travels and their continued patronage with us speaks about their faith in Noori Travels.</p>

				<h2 class="text-left">Customer service - our way of life</h2>
				
				<br/>
                <p><i><strong>What you do is who you are, not what you say you’ll do.</strong></i></p>

						<p>Our brand is the most valuable thing we own - we do 
						business every day as if our success depends upon the 
						company’s good name – because it does. Our 
						reputation is our most precious asset.</p> 
						
						<br/>
						
						<p>Noori Travels has worked hard on the brand building 
						through its near immaculate service it offers to its clients.</p>
					</div>		
				</div>		
				<br/>
				
				<p>Customer service is our way of life - we maintain an uncompromising focus on customer service, from our distinctive 
				professional dress and courteous demeanor, to directly linking career advancement opportunities to the actual customer 
				service we provide. Customers seek out – and stay with – Noori because our people believe in and deliver courteous, 
				personalized service every day.</p> 
				
				<br/>
				
				<p>Our goal is to exceed every customer’s expectations. Great things happen when we hear to our customer and to each other 
				- we have learned that when we truly listen to our customers and understand their needs and expectations, they lead us to 
				opportunities. From little ways to serve them better, to new lines of business that open up exciting growth prospects for our 
				company. At Noori, we understand that an open and respectful exchange of ideas is critical to maintaining our high 
				standards for service and personal success.</p>
				
				<br/>
				
				<p>We strengthen our communities, one neighborhood at a time – Noori Travels is a ‘Local’ company. Unlike our competitors, we 
				have a presence in thousands of neighborhoods, placing us on a first-name basis with the people who call those 
				neighborhoods home. We generate tax rupees through sales and employment, create meaningful jobs that generate 
				significant income and benefits for employees and their families, and much more. We realize we owe our success to 
				the support and goodwill of the people who live in those communities and who do business with us.</p> 
				
				<br/>
				
				<p>That’s why we are committed to involving ourselves in the support of worthwhile endeavors in the hometowns and cities where 
				we operate our business.</p>
